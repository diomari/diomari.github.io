Allow me to introduce myself a little bit.</p>\n<p>I’m <em>Diomari Madulara</em>. A software engineer based in Davao, Philippines. My journey started several years ago when our high school teacher introduced C language to our class. We did not make any serious application back then but I was hooked by the joy of inputting commands to a computer. For me, it felt revolutionary. </p>\n<p>After getting a degree in Computer Science I worked on an agency where we use Python/Django to build web applications for businesses and startups. Since then, the majority of my time and effort goes to designing and building applications for the web.</p>\n<p>This blog was created to serve as an archive for the things I’ve learned in my career.  I usually write practical guides from building an application to sharing tools for both design and development work. I hope you can find value on the things being posted here. </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c94dbe79852af2a3e720cb55aa563c2a/11311/onerent.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.64285714285714%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Onerent One Team!\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/c94dbe79852af2a3e720cb55aa563c2a/7a431/onerent.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c94dbe79852af2a3e720cb55aa563c2a/bba83/onerent.jpg 148w,\n/static/c94dbe79852af2a3e720cb55aa563c2a/88c97/onerent.jpg 295w,\n/static/c94dbe79852af2a3e720cb55aa563c2a/7a431/onerent.jpg 590w,\n/static/c94dbe79852af2a3e720cb55aa563c2a/2879f/onerent.jpg 885w,\n/static/c94dbe79852af2a3e720cb55aa563c2a/9833c/onerent.jpg 1180w,\n/static/c94dbe79852af2a3e720cb55aa563c2a/11311/onerent.jpg 1400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Today, I currently work on a startup where we simplify the experience of renting.
